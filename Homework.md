Stripe is a global technology company that builds economic infrastructure for the internet. 
Businesses of every size from new startups to public companies like Salesforce and Facebook use the company’s software to accept online payments and run complex global operations.

Stripe combines economic infrastructure with a set of applications for new business models like crowdfunding and marketplaces, fraud prevention, analytics, and more. Stripe navigates global regulatory uncertainty and partners closely with internet leaders like Apple, Google, Alipay, Tencent, Facebook, Twitter to launch new capabilities.

Stripe wants to help more companies get started and thrive and ultimately to grow the GDP of the internet.

Stripe is yet another powerful payment platform designed for internet businesses, with the company claiming to handle billions of dollars worth of transactions annually. 

The main difference between this service and many others is that it isn’t an out-of-the-box solution. 
Instead, you’re provided with a range of flexible tools to customize your own payment processes. 

Designed for larger firms, it offers a plethora of APIs that allow you to create your own subscription services, on-demand marketplaces, 
or crowdfunding platforms. It supports a range of development languages, including Ruby, Python, PHP and Java. 

Furthermore, Stripe supports more than a hundred currencies, and offers features such as mobile payments, 
subscription billing and one-click checkout. Users also get access to a dashboard where they can visualize transactions. 
Clearly, then, this is a feature-rich payment gateway, although Stripe does demand a lot more technological knowledge from the user than most providers.

Stripe offers a particular advantage to merchants based in Europe, as card processing fees for European cards are 1.4% + 20p per transaction. 
For non-European cards processing fees are a more standard 2.9%, plus $0.30 per charge. Additionally, for larger volume needs, it has a customized plan with volume discounts.
